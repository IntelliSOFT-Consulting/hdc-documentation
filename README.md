# Health Data commons Mamatoto documentation

## Introduction

This repository contains the documentation for the Mamatoto project. The Mamatoto project is a project that aims to demonstrate the use of the Health Data Commons (HDC) platform to support the standardization, sharing and analysis of data from a pregnancy journey. The project is a collaboration between [Pharmaccess](https://www.pharmaccess.org/), [Intellisoft Consulting](https://www.intellisoftkenya.com/), [turnio](https://www.turn.io/) and [carepay](https://www.carepay.com/).

## How to work with Quarto and GitHub

### Getting started

- Read the short introduction on how author documents in markdown using Quarto ([link](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html))
- Read the short introduction on how to use branches in the GitHub flow for version control ([link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)).
- Read how to use the web IDE for GitHub ([link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/))
  - The short introduction to this workflow is that everyone works in their own branch, and changes to the document are merged into the `main` branch. This way, we can work on the document simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

### Working in the online editor

- Navigate to [online editor](https://github.dev/PharmAccess/hdc_documentation), this will launch your online editor
- Click on the branching icon on the bottom left. A pop-up appears where you can select the branch to work on. Select your own branch.
